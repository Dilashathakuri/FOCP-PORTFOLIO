# Practical Programs Repository

This repository contains practical programs and projects completed during college, including homework assignments and college-sent projects.

## Contents:

### 1. Homework Programs
- Various practical exercises and assignments received from LBU.
- These include coding challenges, algorithms, and tasks completed as part of the coursework.

### 2. Projects
- **Project 1: Chatbot**
  - A simple chatbot implemented in Python.
  - Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interact with users.
  - Includes features like keyword matching and basic conversational flow.
  
- **Project 2: Futsal Management System**
  - A GUI-based futsal management system developed using Tkinter.
  - **Purpose**:

      - Book futsal grounds with details like date, time, and field.
      - Save and view matches between teams.
      - Manage all data using Excel files for storage.

### 3. How the App Works:

#### 1. **Start:**
   - The app begins at the login page.
   - New users can go to the register page to create an account.

#### 2. **Home Page:**
   - After logging in, users are directed to the home page with options to:
     - **Add players**: Input details like name, contact, and team of the players.
     - **Book futsal grounds**: Choose the date, time, and field to book the futsal ground.
     - **Manage data**: View and save all player and booking information.
     
   - The app also allows users to check and view the history of their bookings and player information.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for all programs.
- **Tkinter**: Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Futsal Management System.
- **Pandas/Excel**: Used for storing and managing data (player details, match bookings, etc.) in Excel files.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

3. Run the specific project:
   - For the **Chatbot** project:
     ```bash
     python chatbot.py
     ```
   - For the **Futsal Management System** project (uses Tkinter):
     ```bash
     python futsal_management_system.py
     ```
