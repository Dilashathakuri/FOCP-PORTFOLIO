###TASK: Write some code that calls the print() function several times, displaying your name, address and contact details. Add additional calls to the print() function which includes an argument that calculates and prints the length of your name, by calling the len() function.

name = "Dilasha"
address = "home"
contact = "number"

print(name)
print(address)
print(contact)

# Calculate and print the length of the name
name_length = len(name)
print("Length of name:", name_length)
